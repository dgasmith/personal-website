# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This webinar will continue the discussion of open source software (OSS) opportunities within the scientific ecosystem to include the many cloud and local services available to OSS free of charge. The services to be discussed include continuous integration, code coverage, and static analysis. The presenters will demonstrate the usefulness of these tools and how a small time investment at the beginning is traded for long-term benefits. These services and ideas are agnostic to software language or HPC software application and should apply to any party interested in tools that help ease the burden of software maintenance."
