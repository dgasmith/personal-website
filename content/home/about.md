# Biography

Dr. Daniel Smithâ€™s Ph.D. research formally focused on the interactions of small
molecules with carbon nanotubes and the interactions between small molecules of
a special (multireference) character.  He learned that, in practice this turns
out to require the same tasks with an extremely high degree of repetition from
running many computations, to deriving equations, or implementing quantum
chemical methodologies. His natural allergic reaction to such work led him to
devote a large amount of his time building automated tools with the Python
language!
